      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm <strong>Nikhil Sangale</strong>, a full‑stack developer who enjoys turning ideas into
        reliable products. I build responsive React apps, design API‑driven backends in
        Python/Flask and Java/Spring Boot, and deploy scalable services on AWS with Docker.
      </p>
      <p>
        My recent work spans <strong>Generative AI</strong> and automation—shipping an ATS that
        analyzes resumes with ~90% matching accuracy, and creating real‑time systems like
        a Spring Boot chat app. I also build web‑scraping and data tools, including a Chrome
        extension for structured e‑commerce extraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        I care about clean architecture, performance, and developer experience. My stack
        includes React, JavaScript, Python, Java, Flask, Spring Boot, MySQL, MongoDB,
        REST APIs, Docker, Git/GitHub/Bitbucket, Postman, Jira, and AWS EC2.
